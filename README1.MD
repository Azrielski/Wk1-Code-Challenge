CHALLENGE 1
function getstudentGrade(studentMarks){} 
=> I used the function getstudentGrade and added the parameter studentMarks so the
function can use it.

if and else if
= with the use of IF statements, i set up a range for the grades and conditions to it so that the 
function may know where to opperate the and output the values from..
and with the use of the RETURN statements, it is then able to output the grade of the student
